# NYPD_Frisk_Data_Analysis
Assignment realized for Esade in which I proceeded to the inspection of the Stop, Question and Frisk Data released by the New York Police Department every year.

Since the initial data files are too large (over 25MB) to be uploaded here, you can find the source files at the following link: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page.
